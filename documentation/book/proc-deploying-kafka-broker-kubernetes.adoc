= Deploying the Kafka broker to {KubernetesName}

.Prerequisites

* Before deploying a Kafka broker, the Cluster Operator must be deployed.
* To deploy a Kafka cluster, a `Kafka` resource with the cluster configuration has to be created.

.Procedure

. If you are planning to use the Kafka broker for development or testing, create an ephemeral cluster
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f examples/kafka/kafka-ephemeral.yaml
----

. If you are planning to use the Kafka broker in production, create a persistent cluster
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f examples/kafka/kafka-persistent.yaml
----

.Additional resources
